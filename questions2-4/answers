2a. I would have check access to route 53 server.
 - Check misconfiguration on TEST EC2 dns resolver.
 - Check if route table on DEV TGW properly configured to pass traffic from TEST      SPOKE VPC to INSPECTION VPC and the other way around.
 - Check if CHECKPOINT FW EC2 passing traffic from TEST EC2 and let traffic out from the INSPECTION VPC.
 - Check if there is an ACL on the TEST SPOKE VPC which let traffic out, but don't let traffic in as it's stateless unlike security group.
 - Can also check ACL on INSPECTION VPC

 2b. Problem maybe the TEST EC2 isn't routing correctly through NAT GW.
 - Check routing to EGRESS VPC via the DEV TGW.
 - Check security group and ACL of TEST SPOKE VPC and TEST EC2
 - Check NFW on the EGRESS VPC to see if it's not blocking traffic from TEST EC2.
 - Check if NAT GW is up and running

 2ci. Check if repository exists, or if there is a need to login credentials.
 - Check if syntax is correct when trying to pull.
 - Check if image is allowed to be pulled in nexus.
 - Check if TEST EC2 can reach NEXUS EC2

 2cii. Check network connection and route table between TEST VPC and ALM VPC
 - Check latency or bandwith between the TEST and ALM VPCs.
 - Check if NEXUS EC2 is maybe under a high load and can't react on time
 - Maybe is using DNS to reach NEXUS EC2 the DNS resolve takes too much time.

 2ciii. Check systemctl to see if docker daemon is running or even existing
 - Check logs to see if there is a problem with docker daemon
 - Maybe a problem with user permissions
 - Maybe the EC2 is under lots of stress or disk is full so it can't perform actions. 

 3. Check security group to see if it accepts incoming traffic in port 443.
 - Check ACL that allow traffic in in port 443
 - Check maybe a problem with TLS certificate configuration on the service.
 - Check the service logs.

 4. sudo yum install telnet
 - Can be a problem if repo isn't updated so i would use sudo yum update.
 - Maybe there is a need to add a repo with this command: 
    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo <repo.address.repo>
